Allows you to start a new chat by forking an existing one. The new chat will include all the content of the old one up to that point (or a summary of the content up to that point) and optionally any attachments.

## Speech to text

REMINDER TO SELF, FILL IN THE SCREENSHOTS LATER, SOMETHING BROKE BECAUSE OF COURSE IT DID

Uses groq (You have to provide your own API key) to recognize speech from your microphone and send it as text.

## Text to speech

Uses elevenlabs (bring your own key) to speak messages out loud. Includes options for auto-speaking, and character-based attribution with actor mode (so you can define different voices for different characters).

## Exporting

You can export a chat to various formats. Txt, JSON, etc.

## Preferences switcher

Adds a dropdown to the sidebar to let you switch between different preferences. You can create/edit presets in the settings.

## Style selector

Allows you to set a style for a given chat, which will take precedence over the global style.
