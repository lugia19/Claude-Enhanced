# Claude Toolbox Extension

Available on the Desktop Client using [Claude-WebExt-Patcher](https://github.com/lugia19/claude-webext-patcher)

I'll be publishing it to the Chrome/Firefox stores once I've added some more features to it.

Right now it basically just loads the userscripts you can already get on greasyfork.

# Claude Fork Button

![fork_button](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a7e7a82f-9a8d-4cef-b5f6-a9bb9f5decdc)

Adds a "Fork" button to the AI's messages, which creates a new conversation, attaching the chatlog up to the point you forked as a file.

It will copy over any attachments/files you have added to the conversation as well.

# Claude Long Conversation Typing Lag Fix

Fixes the lag issues whilst typing that happen in long chats, by swapping the text input with a custom one.

This breaks the "live preview" of formatting (though it does still show up correctly after the fact). One exception is codeblocks that also contain triple backticks will look kinda glitchy. Not much I can do.
